/* ACCESS MODIFIER NOTES:

- In order to gain access to methods/ objects/ or another Class we need to set Access Modifier


There are two types of Access Modifiers:

1) Class level
2) Object Level (Methods, Attributes etc.)

=====================================================


CLASS LEVEL ACCESS MODIFIERS:

Public : Gives the access to classes in any packages
Default: Gives the access to classes in the same packages only.



OBJECT LEVEL ACCESS MODIFERS:
Public    : Gives the access to classes in any packages
Default   : Gives the access to classes in the same packages only.
Private   : Gives the access within the same class only
Protected : Same as default, but if we extend it, it gives access to other packages. 
Final     : There is no way to access this from another Classes.



======================================================

* Static: If we use static keyword, we can access the method from the same
* class without creating an object. We still need to create object if we
* need to access from different class.
